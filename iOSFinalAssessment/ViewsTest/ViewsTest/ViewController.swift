            For this test you'll implement a basic tab bar view controller. You must implement one tab bar view controller with two distinct sub view controllers. One view controller must show a fully functioning map with the ability to switch between Default, Satellite, AND Hybird map formats. 
        
            The other must implement a fully functioning web browser whose homepage is your favorite search engine.
